# 🎬 Video Editing Course Website – Frontend UI (Design to Code)

A fully hand-coded, **responsive frontend user interface** developed for a video editing course website using **HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript** — built entirely from scratch based on UI designs created in **Photoshop, XD, and Canva**.

This project was later converted into a custom WordPress theme (see [WordPress Repo](https://github.com/Armanhussain707/video-editing-wp-theme)), but this version represents the raw **frontend-only version**, demonstrating **pixel-perfect UI**, **responsiveness**, and a strong **design-to-code** workflow — **without using any page builders or frameworks**.
